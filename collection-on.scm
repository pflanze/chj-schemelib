;; Unlike wbcollection this separates .key and .eq? functions (instead
;; of having them grouped into one function, e.g. through |on|), and
;; thus can offer lookups by keys instead of whole objects.

;; "Just" wbcollections with an easier interface, which is also shown
;; with |show|. Requires .cmp to be defined for the key type in
;; question.
