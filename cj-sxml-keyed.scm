  by keyed->sxml and sxml->keyed is not really that (at least not
  as implemented by gambit's keyword function arguments):
  for this module, keyword/value pairs can be put anywhere
  in a list, not only at the end. Since in XML and SXML attributes are
  put near the start tag (\"function name\"), this is allowed here as
  well. But that might make sml->keyed unsuitable for production of
  function code. Maybe more functions for dealing with this will
  follow in the future.")
